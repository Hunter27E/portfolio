# 3rd Party Script

I chose to add the Google Analytics tracking script to my website. I think this
will be very helpful in seeing the traffic on my portfolio and getting a better
handle on the performance and usability of my site in order to better optimize
it for the future. That may mean optimizing for a certain device, improving
a certain page, or some other change to make recruiters more intrigued by my
site and more interested in hiring me.
