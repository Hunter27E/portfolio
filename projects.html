					<p>
						For people who want to keep track of the movies they've seen and
						easily get recommendations for their weekend movie nights. Users can
						search any title, read its synopsis and cast, find movies similar to
						it, and see where they can stream the movie. Users with accounts can
						like, dislike, and rate movies they've seen and store them in their
						movie catalogue. They can then get personalized movie
						recommendations by genre, actor, and similar movies.
