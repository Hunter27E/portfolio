							Hiking, camping, bouldering. Desert, forest, mountains. I'm all
							for it. I've visited 15 National Parks in five states and have
							Olympic and Hawaii Volcanoes on my radar. If I could code out in
							the wild, I would.

				<h2>What Are My Goals?</h2>
				<p>
					I'm studying at UCSD as a computer science major to become a UI
					designer and developer. Coming into college I had no idea what
					computer science was until I took my first course freshman year. That
					class introduced me to something so new and expansive that I chose to
					pursue the major. Computer science is nothing like I had ever learned
					before, and that is why I pursue the career.
