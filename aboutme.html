				<h2>Who Am I?</h2>
				<div id="whoami">
					<p>
						My name is Hunter Estrada and I am from Los Angeles, CA. I am a 3rd
						year student at UCSD majoring in computer science to become a UI
						designer. I am also an avid outdoorsman and sports fan. Basketball
						and the Lakers. I've played since I was five and still play to this
						day. I love going to the Staples Center and seeing the Lakers play.
						The outdoors. Hiking, camping, bouldering, road-tripping. Desert,
						forest, mountains, beach. All of it. I love visiting National Parks,
						Joshua Tree and Mount Rainier being my favorites. The fresh air, the
						still quietness, the grand landforms - there's nothing better.

				<h2>What Are My Goals?</h2>
				<p>
					I'm studying at UCSD as a computer science major to become a UI
					designer and developer. Coming into college I had no idea what
					computer science even was until I took my first course freshman year.
					That class introduced me to something so new and expansive that I
					chose to pursue the major. Computer science is nothing like I had ever
					learned before, and that is why I pursue the career.
