				<h2>What Am I Interested In?</h2>
				<p>
					Basketball and the Lakers. I've played since I was five and still play
					to this day. I love going to the Staples Center and seeing the Lakers
					play.
					<br />
					The outdoors. Hiking, camping, bouldering, road-tripping. Desert,
					forest, mountains, beach. All of it. I love visiting National Parks,
					Joshua Tree and Mount Rainier being my favorites. The fresh air, the
					still quietness, the grand landforms - there's nothing better.

				<h2>What Are My Goals?</h2>
				<p>
					I'm studying at UCSD as a computer science major to become a UI
					developer. Coming into college I had no idea what computer science
					even was until I took my first course freshman year. That class
					introduced me to something so new and expansive that I chose to pursue
					the major. Computer science is nothing like I had ever learned before,
					and that is why I pursue the career.
