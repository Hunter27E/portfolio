							Hello, my name is Hunter. I'm a 3rd year CS student at UCSD. Was

							Basketball. I've watched since I was a baby and played since I
							could walk. Being an LA native, I'm always up for a Lakers game at
							Staples Center.

							Hiking, camping, bouldering. Desert, forest, mountains. I'm all
							for it. I've visited 15 National Parks in five states and have
							Olympic and Hawaii Volcanoes on my radar. If I could code out in
							the wild, I would.

				<h2>What Are My Goals?</h2>
				<p>
					I'm studying at UCSD as a computer science major to become a UI
					designer and developer. Coming into college I had no idea what
					computer science was until I took my first course freshman year. That
					class introduced me to something so new and expansive that I chose to
					pursue the major. Computer science is nothing like I had ever learned
					before, and that is why I pursue the career.
